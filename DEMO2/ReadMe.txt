Here is the Demo2 Repo. This handles getting the bot to search for an Aruco Marker, then when it spots it with the RPI Camera, it sends the right angle and position to the Arduino
and then drives there. Once it gets to about a foot of the Marker, it drives around in a perfect circle and stops right where it began.
